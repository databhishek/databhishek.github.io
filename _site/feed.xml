<content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/metro/">&lt;p&gt;For a while, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was around 6:30 PM when I reached the station. The day seemed to be coming down slowly as I heaved my backpack through the security checkpoint, up the stairs and into the metro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With no seats being available, (which is the usual case) I stood leaning on the glass that bordered a row of seats, near the door. Soon enough, the voice chimed, and the doors went shut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the metro didn’t move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This happened sometimes, and thus I just stood there staring blankly into the void. After a while, I felt hungry, and so I took out my way-past-lunch box and started eating, an activity I would have loved to do while being seated, but fate didn’t approve of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minutes passed. Till then, people had tried to gently knock open the metro door, as if they were trying to enter someone’s home, a weird couple had smiled at me for a minute while I was eating and I’d finished the monotonous activity of chewing all my meal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then, I waited. A whole 15 minutes must have passed when finally the metro moved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It went on for some time, with people cramming in like none of their business. It was a Wednesday, around 7 PM. I should have known better. I went on looking over people’s shoulders trying to find out which secret they were trying to text their buddies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The metro came to a halt again at Mayur Vihar, where it stood again for around 10 minutes before moving. Nobody significant entered or exited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It stopped again. This time not at a station, but just around 100 metres before Yamuna Bank. I was getting fed up, but the other option was complaining out loud about how the metro sucks and how we should press the ‘emergency’ button and talk to the driver like other people in my compartment were doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stuck to being silent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the metro moved again and reached the Yamuna Bank metro station in what seemed like an eternity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After repeating customary lines like - “Ma’am, could you please get aside?” or “Excuse me, sir.”, I finally got out of the metro and went to the other platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I noticed was a big ruckus. Also, people taking selfies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evidently, a metro hadn’t arrived to go to Vaishali for such a long time that a herd of people had assembled at the place. Every time a horn blared, the people whistled and chanted only to discover that the metro arriving wasn’t the one they were waiting for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people just gave up and sat beside the stairs in the hope that a metro might come. Others teetered on the edge of the platform to look for any sign of lights approaching from the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there were the people who raised their phones up through the crowd. Some were looking at their video camera to catch a glimpse of the metro; others were just taking a selfie. What in god’s name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me? I stood there without a single shred of hope that I was getting home anytime soon. Even if a metro did arrive, the already overflowing metro wouldn’t have accommodated 1% of the herd standing there, and I wasn’t going to be a part of that 1%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, I called up my father to get me out of there and thus began my journey to reach the extraction point. Just to get out well and alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I moved down and straight with a sea of people also attempting to exit the station. You didn’t need to move at all, actually. The people pushing from behind carried you with them. I went along the tide. It moved slowly and painfully. I finally managed to reach the top, only to discover that the rate of people exiting vs. the people coming in was highly disproportionate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everybody pushed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the authorities gave in, and the door was forced open. Nobody was to swipe their card, a benefit for the metro service as they could now take quite an amount of penalty money from us. I did hear some women shouting from behind me, but at the moment couldn’t figure out whether it was directed at me or someone else. I continued pushing, and everyone came out to a dreary night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started walking immediately because that’s what everyone else seemed to be doing at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than a thousand people walked on the left side of the road that went out of the Yamuna Bank station. Nobody had discussed this amongst each other, but there seemed to be a silent truce that vehicles on the right, people on the left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I broke off the crowd for a moment and looked in the distance. I was at a religious tourist attraction where a line of people was moving along to get a glimpse of their God. For the moment, that God never seemed to arrive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People were still taking selfies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I noticed a few individuals disappearing under what seemed to be the tracks. There was a huge crowd gathered round, and when I tried to look down, I was met with thorns from a bush. I suffered thorns in my arm trying to fend off the enemy. A person warned me that thorns were dangerous foes and I thought it better to move along further down the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few more minutes of walking, I finally saw my destination. I was sweating like I had just run a marathon and carrying the heavy backpack had been a nightmare, but there was the brightly lit main road. Now, just the wait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was thirsty when I finally did reach and looked around if I could find water or a soft drink anywhere. There, I found a small stall managed by a senior man. He looked fed up of the crowd that was demanding stuff from him but obliged anyway. This was probably his most successful night after all. My attempts were unsuccessful, though, as water seemed to have run out and he was busier giving people Marlboro and Captain than giving me anything to drink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I left and stood there, looking at the long line of cars that blocked the road and wondered how long it would take for dad to arrive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first good news of the day, he came soon enough. I sat in the extraction vehicle, a Chevrolet Sail (the best in class) and we took off. There I noticed how far people had come from the station. They were probably going to walk home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I don’t know. I was in the car, and a tiring journey was now over. I felt momentary pity for them as I leaned back and dozed off.&lt;/p&gt;

<id>http://localhost:4000/clocks</id>
<content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/clocks/">&lt;p&gt;Tick tock, tick tock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kevin got up from his chair, keeping the book aside. It was time for sleep. He checked the clock; it was 1:43 AM. No time to be awake. He turned the lamp off, and entered the bed, closing his eyes, losing his consciousness slowly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sound of the clock was interrupting him. He hadn’t noticed it till now, apparently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;’For the sake of sleep, shut the hell up.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tick tock, tick…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;￼He realised clocks didn’t turn themselves off, apparently. Why couldn’t there be voice controlled clocks?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘I would buy one if they just MADE IT!’ He shouted to his conscious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing. It was still going. Looks like no matter what, the clock wasn’t going to listen to him. He’d have to get up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Hsjsajad’, he mumbled random letters as he got up. Probably his way to curse. He pressed the ‘snooze’ button. No shit, it was going. It was still going. He pressed it harder, he pressed it a thousand times. Bet he broke the world record for the most snoozing in a minute. And it kept going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘This thing is determined’ he thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kevin couldn’t sleep like this. He moved towards the sofa to sleep. He lay there, closing his eyes, losing his consciousness slowly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again. Tick tock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Now WHAT? Can’t a gentleman sleep or what! DAMN YOU!’ So much for being a gentleman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was too much. Kevin got up in rage, checking all around him the origin of the sound so he could thrash the thing that was doing this with a hammer, so it dare not make such a sound again. No sign, the room was void of any clock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the clock in the room had stopped, apparently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where was this sound coming from then? Kevin moved to check the area around the sofa, looking at every corner. Nothing, this was a dark, clock free space of cheap Ikea furniture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sound was coming from somewhere, but Kevin couldn’t figure it out. It was impossible to sleep in such sound, even if he stuffed sound proof glass in his ears. He moved a bit around the house. Not in search of anything, but for a seemingly quieter place where this sound could not reach. The house was small, so it was hard to find a place where this horrible thing wouldn’t pierce his mind. Horrible it was, it was a monster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Upstairs maybe’, he thought. Maybe there he’d find tranquillity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He walked upstairs. The sound of the clock was faint now, but he could still hear it. He moved to enter the only room which was upstairs; maybe it couldn’t penetrate the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tick tock, tick tock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It became louder! This was getting harder to figure out at the moment. Where was this sound coming from? Kevin was pretty sure that there was no clock at all on the upper floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then, how? He was utterly confused. A puzzled expression covered his face. He looked out the window of the second floor. The neighbourhood was a ghost town. Not a soul was to be found roaming around. A soft breeze was blowing, as was evident from the leaves of the flying around aimlessly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘At least they get to enjoy quiet’, he thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something turned his attention back to the house. The sound had just become even louder, with still whatsoever no direction where it was coming from. It seemed to vibrate through all the walls. It was everywhere, apparently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was getting unbearable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kevin was scared. It was evident this was nothing of this universe. Where else did clocks would you find so monstrous? The thing was made to ‘wake you up’, not to ‘keep you up.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time, clock, the sound; these were eating him alive. He darted downstairs. Bet he broke the world record for the fastest time to descend stairs too. He was at the door in an instant, and he turned the knob. One more second and he would die of this sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He didn’t. But the door didn’t open. It was locked, apparently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He had an idea; a light shone in his mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘I am saved!’ exclaimed he.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He rushed towards the phone. He picked it up and put it to his ear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tick tock, tick tock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was coming through the speaker of the phone also, apparently. Brilliant, his last attempt at redemption and this is what he gets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this moment, just as the clock chimed off the hour, horror and serenity merged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kevin sat down and kept quiet. The sound of clocks continued to reverberate. They buzzed, they chimed, they rang. But his mind was empty. His voice was empty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was empty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then, the world was empty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He opened his eyes. He was in his bed; it was 7. Birds were chirping and light reflected throughout the room. The clock was buzzing uncontrollably, apparently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tick tock, tick tock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And he pressed snooze. It became quiet again. Kevin went to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

<content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/christmas/">&lt;p&gt;T’was the day of Christmas,
the day shone bright and cold.
Snowflakes fell and the bells did toll,
spreading the magic of the ole’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kids all sung in a merry voice,
the kingdom swayed with elation.
The carol of Christmas here was sung,
thus was the choice of creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But oh, fate did fare not so well!
the Devil did arrive.
With his hairy body and horns of doom,
To punish did he connive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The people ran, all left and right,
and wandered in every direction.
Oh the day was not so bright!
The storm came ‘nay affection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A light thus shone from heavens above,
It took the storm by storm.
Oh the glow of glistening light,
and thereby froze the swarm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The light did fall on the Devil’s body.
He could only watch astounded.
The Devil disintegrated into dust.
The crowd did cheer around him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thus in the bleak of winter cold, the lights here shine.
The frosty winds whisper and snowflakes rhyme.
The dawn approaches swift with light,
water is stone, hearth alight.&lt;/p&gt;

<id>http://localhost:4000/revolution</id>
<content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/revolution/">&lt;p&gt;We were the oppressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thrown by the society, a mere fragment of broken glass shattered by the hopeless world. In a mere blink of the eyes, we vanished, torn and undone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were the outlaws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mocked, frowned upon. We were the creators of destruction, the facilitators of glory. For in us rested the future, and in us we faced the present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were the stars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some were with us, then by definition, others against us. And what is life, without enemies to face together with friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were unique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For we were the oppressed, the outlaws and the stars. And without us this nation would never be the same. And for that very same reason, we rose. Rose for the truth, for the lie and for those who were with us and against us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were no sides, but a crusade against time and what was right. And in the end, all that mattered was a dauntless and ceaseless light, for that guided us to oblivion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s why we are the revolutionaries. Mere mortals in the face of god, we struck back. We were violent in peace, loud in silence and full in an empty void.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we live on today, in memories, in truth and in the lives of the billions of people who remember us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if we may be forgotten some day, the revolution will live on. Today, tomorrow and eternally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For we are the eternal, the incessant and the infinite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we, are forever.&lt;/p&gt;
