        The Revolution
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">19 Feb 2016</span>

    <p>We were the oppressed.</p>

<p>Thrown by the society, a mere fragment of broken glass shattered by the hopeless world. In a mere blink of the eyes, we vanished, torn and undone.</p>

<p>We were the outlaws.</p>

<p>Mocked, frowned upon. We were the creators of destruction, the facilitators of glory. For in us rested the future, and in us, we faced the present.</p>

<p>We were the stars.</p>

<p>For some were with us, then by definition, others against us. And what is life, without enemies to face together with friends?</p>

<p>We were unique.</p>

<p>For we were the oppressed, the outlaws and the stars. And without us, this nation would never be the same. And for that very same reason, we rose. Rose for the truth, for the lie and for those who were with us and against us.</p>

<p>There were no sides, but a crusade against time and what was right. And in the end, all that mattered was a dauntless and ceaseless light, for that guided us to oblivion.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why we are the revolutionaries. Mere mortals in the face of God, we struck back. We were violent in peace, loud in silence and full in an empty void.</p>

<p>We live on today, in memories, in truth and in the lives of the billions of people who remember us.</p>

<p>Even if we may be forgotten some day, the revolution will live on. Today, tomorrow and eternally.</p>

<p>For we are the eternal, the incessant and the infinite.</p>

<p>And we, are forever.</p>
