	<p>Hi! My name is Abhishek Singh.</p>

<p>I’m an 18-year-old high school student in India.</p>

<p>In my free time, you can find me <a href="https://github.com/databhishek">programming</a>, speedcubing or playing the guitar. Maybe all of those together.</p>

<h1> Interests </h1>

<h2> Academics </h2>
<p>My primary motive is solving hard problems that interest me and I am technology agnostic in this regard. I’m highly interested in statistics and probability and am looking to pursue data science in the coming years and hopefully find myself in the field of machine learning.</p>

<h2> Movies &amp; TV </h2>
<p>I mainly like science-fiction movies, though what I watch depends on my mood at the time. Fight Club is hands-down my favourite movie of all-time and I love Star Wars, Goodfellas and Pulp Fiction.</p>

<p>My current favourite TV show is Silicon Valley. I’ve watched Mr. Robot, Agents of SHIELD, House of Cards, Game of Thrones, Sherlock, Westworld, True Detective and Black Mirror.</p>

<h2> Books </h2>
<p>The majority of my reading consists of non-fiction books. When I do read fiction, it is mostly sci-fi or fantasy. I keep track of what I read on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/66894642-abhishek-singh">Goodreads</a> so follow me there if you want to check out what I’m reading. I will suggest some books here that I absolutely loved.</p>

<h2> Music </h2>
<p>Most of the time, I’ll listen to anything. However, I have a strong preference for alternative rock, for which I mainly listen to Arctic Monkeys, Franz Ferdinand and Miles Kane. I also really like Silicon Valley’s soundtrack, it has some really catchy songs.</p>

<p>I don’t listen to music when I’m programming but sometimes I’ll put on music with no lyrics when I’m doing some task. For this, I usually play indie game soundtracks, Thomas Was Alone’s OST and To The Moon’s OST being particularly good in this regard.</p>

<h2> Miscellaneous </h2>

<p>I can solve the 3x3 cube in about 40 seconds. I use the Fridrich method but I cannot seem to remember the OLL algorithms for my life, so I have a lot of scope for improvement.</p>

<p>I am also a novice at the guitar and usually just play the few songs that I know, most of which are theme songs from various shows and movies.</p>

<p>I don’t watch any sport per say, but I tune in for some NBA games now and then. I don’t watch football, but if asked, my favourite team is Tottenham Hotspur in the BPL and Barcelona overall. I don’t have any preference for any team in the NBA, but I really like watching the Golden State Warriors and Chicago Bulls play.</p>
