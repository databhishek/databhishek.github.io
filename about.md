I'm Abhishek Singh, a 18 year old high scool student in India.

I like to code a lot. Some projects that I've made:

1. A Recreation of 'Snake' for CLI
2. Tic-Tac-Toe (Underwhelming, I'm aware of it)
3. The popular game '2048' in CLI

I also program competitively. The solutions to some problems can be found [here](https://github.com/databhishek/competitive).

Other than that, I'm proficient at playing the guitar, public speaking and solving the Rubik's Cube (fastest time of 32.47).

_Some of my favorite books_:

* [Slaughterhouse-Five by Kurt Vonnegut](https://www.amazon.com/Slaughterhouse-Five-Novel-Modern-Library-Novels-ebook/dp/B000SEGHT6)

* [Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson](https://www.amazon.com/Steve-Jobs-Walter-Isaacson/dp/1442394935)

* [Moonwalking with Einstein by Joshua Foer](https://www.amazon.com/Moonwalking-Einstein-Science-Remembering-Everything/dp/0143120530)
