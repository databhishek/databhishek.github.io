Hello.

I'm Abhishek, a 18 year old high school student residing in India.

I like to code. I've made some good stuff, which you can check out on my Github.

I like to read a lot. Mostly nonfiction and no self-help if I can help it. I love Vonnegut.

I also play the guitar, sketch, solve the Rubik's cube, debate, quiz, watch Silicon Valley and worry about the future as part of my hobbies. Kind of interested in linguistics.

If you have feedback, want to chat or collaborate on something amazing, just hit me up on [email](mailto:abhi.aryan98@gmail.com)!
