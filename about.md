I'm Abhishek Singh, an 18-year-old high school student in India.

In my free time, you can find me [programming](https://github.com/databhishek), speedcubing or playing the guitar. Maybe all of those together.

If you like to watch [Silicon Valley](www.hbo.com/silicon-valley), we're instant best-friends.

Here are a few books I love.
* [Slaughterhouse-Five by Kurt Vonnegut](https://www.amazon.com/Slaughterhouse-Five-Novel-Modern-Library-Novels-ebook/dp/B000SEGHT6)
* [Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson](https://www.amazon.com/Steve-Jobs-Walter-Isaacson/dp/1442394935)
* [Moonwalking with Einstein by Joshua Foer](https://www.amazon.com/Moonwalking-Einstein-Science-Remembering-Everything/dp/0143120530)
