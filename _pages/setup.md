## _Hardware_

For my mobile devices I am currently using an [iPhone 11 64GB](https://www.apple.com/in/iphone-11/specs/) and an [iPad Air 2020](https://www.apple.com/in/ipad-air/). The iPad mostly gets used for content consumption and reading books through the Kindle app.

Any larger computing needs are fulfilled by my current laptop, a [Dell Inspiron 7560](https://www.dell.com/en-in/shop/cty/pdp/spd/inspiron-15-7560-laptop). It's pretty old at this point and rather slow but it does the job. Work is done on a [Macbook Pro 16"](https://www.apple.com/in/macbook-pro-16/) provided by the company I work for.

To chill at the end of a day I often game on a [Playstation 5](https://www.playstation.com/en-in/ps5/).

## _Software_
The OS of choice on my personal laptop is Windows 10 (*gasp*). I was a long-time Linux user and have gone through most popular distros over the years but I occasionally like playing games on my laptop and hate having to switch operating systems. For any sort of programming work [WSL2 Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/wsl) paired with [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) provides me most of what I need. I'm really not very picky with this sort of stuff now and just use what works.

For work I'm usually coding in Java, for which I use [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) on my Macbook. For any sort of personal development I use either [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/download) or [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). I would switch to VSCode entirely but Sublime is so quick that I keep going back to it. For quick editing I use [Neovim](https://neovim.io/). Shell of choice is [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) with [OhMyZsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) and [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k). Dotfiles for everything can be found [here](https://github.com/databhishek/dotfiles).

I prefer writing notes/articles in Markdown which then go into either [Bear](https://bear.app/) or [Simplenote](https://simplenote.com/) or both.

## _Peripherals_
Since most of my day is spent sitting in front a screen the quality of peripherals makes a huge difference in comfort.

I have a single monitor setup with a [Dell 24" Monitor](https://www.amazon.in/Dell-Screen-LED-Lit-Monitor-P2419H/dp/B07F8XZN69). Going to add a second monitor to this soon with the current one possibly going vertical. Not sure about that right now.

For typing I use an [Epomaker SK64](https://epomaker.com/products/epomaker-sk64) with Gateron Brown switches (with foam I added in the case for those _thonks_). It's definitely better than any membrane keyboard but I am planning to invest in something better down the line. My mouse is only really used when I'm gaming. I have a [Razer Viper](https://www.razer.com/gaming-mice/razer-viper/RZ01-02550100-R3U1) which works well for that purpose.

For music I have a pair of [Sony XB450](https://www.sony.co.in/electronics/headband-headphones/mdr-xb450) cans which are just okay. Planning to get something better soon.

## _Other Stuff_
I have a little plant at my desk from [Ugaoo](https://www.ugaoo.com/). I suggest everyone have a real plant on their desk, really adds to the aesthetic and has a calming feeling to it.

I own a [Yamaha Pacifica 112J](https://www.bajaao.com/products/yamaha-pacifica-112j-electric-guitar) with a [Blackstar ID Core 10 V2](https://www.blackstaramps.com/uk/products/idcore-stereo-10) for when I'm feeling like noodling. I don't really practice much these days but I would really like to get back into it.
