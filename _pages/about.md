Hi. My name is Abhishek Singh. I'm a 19-year-old undergrad at Manipal Institute of Technology, Manipal. I have this website because...umm...I guess it's cool to have a website? I don't know.

I like to code, play the guitar, read and speedcube among other things. Hopefully this place will serve as a medium for me to share my experiences doing all the above and much more.

You can reach out to me at abhi.aryan98\[at]gmail.com

That's mostly about it.
