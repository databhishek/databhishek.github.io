T'was the day of Christmas,

the day shone bright and cold. Snowflakes fell and the bells did toll, spreading the magic of the ole'.

The kids all sung in a merry voice, the kingdom swayed with elation. The carol of Christmas here was sung, thus was the choice of creation.

But oh, fate did fare not so well! the Devil did arrive. With his hairy body and horns of doom, To punish did he connive.

The people ran, all left and right, and wandered in every direction. Oh the day was not so bright! The storm came 'nay affection.

A light thus shone from heavens above, It took the storm by storm. Oh the glow of glistening light, and thereby froze the swarm.

The light did fall on the Devil's body. He could only watch astounded. The Devil disintegrated into dust. The crowd did cheer around him.

And thus in the bleak of winter cold, the lights here shine. The frosty winds whisper and snowflakes rhyme. The dawn approaches swift with light, water is stone, hearth alight.
