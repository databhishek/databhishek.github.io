Flatland is a thought-provoking book, both in the mathematical and cultural sense. 

Its mathematics is simple yet explains ideas about dimensions, shapes and basic geometry elegantly. At the same instant, it is a satire on the Victorian social structure and life.

The penmanship is nothing to write home about, but it's apt to the situation at hand and rarely confusing. People who abhor mathematics as a subject may not like it, but even if you have the tiniest bit of interest and knowledge of it, the book is simple to understand.

The satire presents itself wonderfully, with the habits and rules of Flatland directly mirroring discrimination in the Victorian era. It's not too subtle, and it's not too in-your-face. I liked it a lot.

There's not much else to write. It's a well-done book and one I thoroughly enjoyed. Worth a read.
