Covered is the past, a veil of darkness.

The light of a new dawn arrives. What new does it bring, to those who know? While the unknown scream with delight.

It's a minute before hope, and a minute past the collapse. The rut of daily chores,Â as once again, the times before us elapse.

With promises and vows we go into a new life, But still carry the burdens of the past with us. It's a delusion of a new start that surrounds, That we think life knows no bounds.

Smiles we pass, and toasts we shout, And look at a New Year come. Oh, does everybody in their soul know, The melancholy hum.

In the dawn we arrive with the hope of light, and still go weeping into the dead of night, The times don't change, just count anew, To laugh, to cry, and to bid adieu.
