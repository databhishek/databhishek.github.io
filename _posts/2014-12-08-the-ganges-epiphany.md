There were moments of  beauty,

as I gazed into a black void,

a light shone far-off like the flow of  a reverent power, descending to earth.

Where the chants of silence,

dimmed the sounds of noise.

Where lights illuminated the horizon,

flowing with love, for love.

Where we are never astray,

even when we don't know where to go.

And where we are never forgotten,

even if we fade into oblivion.

Here, we are but a drop among oceans of hope,

and hope my friends, is never lost.

And so with the wings of fire and light of angels,

shall thou be bestowed upon to the aura of the divine

and be lost in an evanescence,

for the manifestation of destiny lies in these fragments.
