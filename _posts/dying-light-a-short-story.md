‘Hello there’

Let me introduce myself. My name, is Richard. Richard Walker. I’m 74,

And I’m about to die.

I've lived for 74 years. 74 years of gloom, insanity, confusion. They called me mad, and I’m sure they’ll be nothing but happy to see me go. People, they call themselves. Monsters, I call them.

Nobody will remember me.

I’m not dying in an accident, nor of a heart attack. I’m just….dying. You know the way people die when they get old, they just kind of stop working. That’s probably how I define it, I’ll stop ‘working’.

So, how does someone feel at death? As for now, I feel pretty normal. What ‘normal’ means here varies from person to person. In reality, I’m shivering madly, I’m cold and can’t move. But that’s normal, because that’s pretty much how I've felt all my life.

That’s pretty much what I've felt in life. Coldness, fear…

There is one thing about death though, your life flashes in front of you, your whole life moments before you are about to die. And what I saw made me shiver even more…

I was born in New York. My mother didn't survive the operation in which I was born. My father died of shock of the loss of her. At least that’s what I was told. I never even saw their faces, except in photographs. They seemed....happy.

Blurred photographs of faded memories.

I had no close by relatives and the doctors wanted to get rid of me as soon as possible, so I was put in an orphanage. It was a dirty place, full of kids like me. Abandoned, thrown, left, alone. And then there was this girl, who had actually been left by her parents here because they never wanted a girl child. Beautiful, she was…

I was there till I was 16. From what I can recount, they had beaten me, tortured me, almost starved me to death, and god knows what else. I’ll be sure to ask when I meet Him.

And then I ran away….far away. I left it behind, I escaped...

I traveled. In an unknown world, unknown direction. Made money by doing petty jobs. I barely survived. And then I traveled again. I ran till I knew there was no place they could catch me. Truth was that I had lost them the moment I had escaped the orphanage, but I was afraid. Even their thought sent a shiver down me spine. I could never go back there, I never wanted to go back there.

And one day I stopped. I stopped running. I was 21. I found a house to rent, and I found a job as a call attendant in a call center. It was a tedious job, but at least it was one. I listened to customers talk trash, shout, and curse daily. It was routine.

Sometimes, I wished I could share with the person I was talking to, what I had gone through. Even though if he/she was a total stranger. But job policy prohibited any kind of chat with the customers. There were managers who walked the place and could listen to calls of any attendant at any moment. If I was caught, I would be fired. Instantaneously.

Then came 26th November,2005. It was freezing cold outside. I was shivering, even though I was inside, and the heater was on.

I was having another nightmare….

These happened often, from time to time. They made me remember all that I suffered. The wounds tore up anew every time. They were horrible dreams of an atrocious life.

I couldn't take it, as I never could any time, and I broke down sobbing. At that moment, a call connected.

‘Hello?’

I was dazed at first. Who on earth was this?

‘Heeelllo?’

‘Yes, ma’am…..W- welcome to Starship Enterprise’ I realized that a customer had called.

‘Were you crying?’

‘No ma’am, it was nothing. What can I do for you?’

‘Don’t lie to me. You were crying. Why, what happened?’

‘No, ma’am it is alright’ I clearly lied, knowing I was not supposed to talk to customers about anything other than our products.

‘Now, you will tell me, or I will never buy anything from you’

I was in shock. A customer, for whom I should have been nothing more than a shadow behind a desk doing a trashy job, was actually ‘caring’ for me. And truth be told, this was more than someone had cared for me in my life by a long shot.

I looked around, checking if any manager was around. There was none.

I told her everything….

And then she told me to meet her. I fazed into another dimension as soon as she said that.

‘Hello, are you there?’ she finally broke the silence.

I snapped back into reality.

‘Yes, Yes, I’m here. When?’ I was so shocked I couldn't say anything else.

‘Noon, by the church’

And then, the phone hung up.

I started off for the church that morning. It was a 10 minute walk from my house.

If you came and asked me at that moment why I was meeting her, I wouldn't have had an answer for you. I don’t even have it now.

Maybe I just wanted to stop, look at life, and share it with someone. Maybe I had high hopes….

I recognized her from a 100 meters away. She was a girl from my orphanage. The very same. I never could forget that face. It was more beautiful than anything in the world. So serene, sweet, a face that made you forget all your problems.

I ran after that. I ran, once again…

Not away this time, but towards her. If this had been coincidence, this was the best one god ever created. This lady was one I could share my pains with, and she would understand….she would get it.

I still think it was the best day I ever spent with her. She was sweet, understanding, and most of all, she cared for me. Which was all I had ever need in life, someone to care.

We went out together for a year after that. It was the time of my life.

And then on November 26th, I bought a ring. It was diamond, it cost $10,000. I had been saving, begging, borrowing that money for the last 8 months, all for her. I wanted to propose her on the very day we had first talked. It would have been a perfect moment. We could live together, share our pains together for the rest of our life.

I had not had a nightmare for the last year…

I chose to do it the traditional way, candle light dinner. I booked the most expensive restaurant in the vicinity. ‘Affranto’, it was.

I called her. She was ecstatic, and surprised. I probably think she would had guessed what was coming, and I very much hoped it would be a ‘yes’. Hope, was something I had gained for the first time in life and it was because of her.

But I never guessed what was coming....

I got there an hour early, I had prepared lines and I was rehearsing them in my mind. They went like this,

‘Will you Marry Me?’

4 words. That’s all I was going to say, and I was rehearsing them. I really think I had gone mad, but these were the hardest words I had ever spoken.

And I sat there. I sat there for 4 hours. I didn't eat, nor drink, I waited, in hope she might come.

Hope, which she had given me.

She didn't. I tried her cell so many times, but it was switched off.

Then I went to her house, it was locked. Upon asking the neighbors, I got to know that she had left the house this morning itself with all her things and they had no whatsoever idea where she was now.

I stood there. I didn't cry, I didn't feel anything. I walked down the stairs, onto the street. I walked. I never searched for her. She was gone, I think.

And then, I collapsed on the ground…

I woke up in a hospital in the morning. I didn't speak, I didn't eat, nor drink. I just lay there.

After they discharged me, my life was useless. It wasn't even supposed to be called ‘life’ at all. I guess it had been useless for a long time, but I never had realized it. I had embraced hope, and hope is a dangerous thing.

The nightmares came back, and with them they brought new ones, of her. They came more often, more intensely. And I just lay there, like a ghost.

How I went about my daily life, I don’t know. I don’t remember. I just somehow survived, that’s all I know. People talked that how I was fired from work and how I was living on the care of the landlady.

I remember none of it…

And ‘care’ no longer had any meaning to me.

I moved away after 2 years of this, after I finally got back to my senses, in senses enough to move away from that horrible place. I ran once again. I had decided never to stop running now. I was neither running away nor towards something. I was just running where destiny took me.

I ran for 50 years...50 long years. I stayed here and there, all over America. I couldn't even remember the times I had stayed in one place. I made no ‘friends’. People everywhere called me crazy, a maniac.I strongly disagree. I had not become mad, or a maniac, I had become…lost. I had become a shadow of life.

I once thought of ending it, my so called ‘life’, but then I couldn't. It would have been cowardly. Says that man who had no courage in life himself. Who had lost everything worth living for, but lived, by the definition of science. He was afraid, to die.

And today, at the age of 74, I have stopped, finally. Stopped running, once again. My life has been nothing much to tell for, it has been filled with fear, coldness, suffering.

Could I have done something in those 50 years, those 50 long years? I don’t know. It’s too late anyways. Maybe, I could have lived a better life once again, but at that time, I think I couldn't fathom it. I couldn't imagine living once again, I had ended my desires long back. 50 years are long, very long and I wasted them in regret.

And today, when I finally think I could live again, it’s too late.

As I lie here, back in New York in a hospital bed, dying on something unknown to me. Time is finally coming to an end for me. The world is a blur, voice a hush, words mere whispers.

I no longer know who I am. Richard Walker died a long time ago, now I’m just a shadow dying in the body of Richard Walker. And it’s time I leave….

And a light flashes in front of me, the brightest I have ever seen.

And I pass away, into eternity.
