Covered is the past, a veil of darkness.

The light of a new dawn arrives. The joy of the new, and the good old past, And that lovely news of delight.

The clocks strike the midnight tune, The stars of desire fill the sky. With new thoughts and empty minds, and little shouts of Goodbye.

With resolutions and anticipation we go into a new life, and leave the burdens of the past behind. It's the grandeur of something new that surrounds, And it is true, that life knows no bounds.

Smiles we pass, and toasts we shout, And look at a New Year come. Oh, does every heart know, The euphoric hum.

In the dawn we arrive with the hope of light, and together, illuminate the beauty of the night, The times do change, and life's sweet, Another year to laugh, to cry and to greet.
