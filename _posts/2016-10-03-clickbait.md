I think clickbait is the reason many of us face information overload daily. Let me explain.

Clickbait exists in more subtle ways than you can notice. A [video like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=5-O2n8FO6Is) is the clear version of it. It’s right there in front of you, and you know it.

Not everything is so in-your-face, though. Vague headlines where the content has little to no relation the headline itself are the norm these days.

We don’t realise this because we’ve been familiarised with it over the years. Such occurrences are so common that we’ve adapted to see them as normal. This is disadvantageous on many levels.

Our brain can only handle so much information at a time. Moreover, when you’re trying to juggle so many events that your brain can’t choose which is important enough to remember, it goes the easy route; it picks the most interesting thing.

This is a problem.

Here’s why. If you study calculus (all hail calculus) and then watch someone like Pewdiepie, you’re more likely to remember the latter, albeit, in the short term, which means that over time you’ll forget the video faster than you’ll forget how to integrate. But regarding strictly one-time occurrences, the more rich experiences come out on top.

Is there a solution to this?

Probably not. It’s almost impossible that anybody’s going to convince anybody to use clear titles and thumbnails. So there’s one thing left, and most people can’t do it.

Self-control. You are the things you consume, and that includes everything on the internet. The more careful you are in what you watch, read and listen to, the better it is for your brain and society in general.

Anybody can do it, not everyone in the years to come will choose to or will be able to do it. This is why deep working individuals are required more than ever before. The concept of 'average' was over years ago, and today the best of the best flourish and a big part of that the focus on essential consumption.

Information is power. But there are two kinds, and most of us seem to choose the worse kind every time.
