It's the shining,

floating around the sky. The silence of vacuum reminiscent of a cold lie.

The pillars of creation,  stretch across the horizon. Wherever the mind flows, it's the zone of the Orion.

Dim get the lights the breathing is heavy. The moment's come and gone it's time to depart already.

Falling into black holes, the lights fadingÂ out. Time freezes here and so do the seas of doubt.

The journey is at it's end, the stars no longer shine. A strange aura floats here, let go of cloud nine.

Writhe with life, spectrum of intensity. I finally close my eyes, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to destiny.
