A desolate void pans on both sides of the eyes, as the tide continues to flow halfway.

He dangles on the edge, as the calm, bone-wrenching winter breeze blows past. A step and a stumble at a time, lurching slowly into darkness, the devil waiting for sins long left unatoned.

Just one more.

Thoughts of abject misery flood the mind, as he turns back for the last time to look at footsteps long forgotten.

_One small step for a man, one giant leap for the mind._

A last drop of crimson red falls from the eyes and joins the river flowing below.

For the first time in life, he feels happiness. The misery, the torture no longer bothers him. The ritual is now complete.

"_I am forever free"_, he mutters.

A sudden thud wakes the neighbours as blood splatters on their window. Sirens chant and people wonder what could have possibly gone wrong to take such a course of action. He doesn't hope to answer anyone, he knows no one will understand this had to be done.

The sacrifices HE had to make.

He glances at the bracelet for a moment and watches from the roof as medics carry a body he is no longer a part of.
