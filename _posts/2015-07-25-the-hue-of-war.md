The treacherous mountain,

that frigid climb. As thunder roared in the sky, and bullets trembled the air. For even the gods only observed that day, and hoped for the fair.

Cracked skulls, crimson blood, lay there with pride. It was the graveyard of hope, it was the abyss of life.

Courage raged so bright that day, that even death did bow in shame. '_Jai Hind!_' roared the javaan, As tears trickled down cheeks, hundreds of miles away.

Nothing else held, more virtue than death that day. As they fell to their god, and eternity fell their way.

Memories remain of an era gone by, when those hearts beat as one. Today, boundaries surpass, the hue of life.

Only a wonder remains, if such a time ever arrive again, when boundaries will be transcended. When two flags will soar in the sky, none higher than the other. And love will rule these lands, for glory still awaits.
